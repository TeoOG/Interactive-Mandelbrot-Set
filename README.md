# Interactive-Mandelbrot-Set
**Explore intricate fractal patterns, zoom in to uncover hidden wonders**


This project is a JavaScript-based visualization of the famous Mandelbrot set, a fascinating fractal that exhibits intricate and self-similar patterns. The Mandelbrot set is represented in the complex plane and is determined by iterating a simple mathematical formula.

**Usage**

**Zoom In:** You can zoom in on the Mandelbrot set by clicking on the canvas or using the "Zoom In" button. When you click on the canvas, the point you clicked will be zoomed in, and the Mandelbrot set will be redrawn to show more detail in that region. Similarly, the "Zoom In" button will zoom in on the center of the canvas.

**Zoom Out:** You can zoom out from the Mandelbrot set by using the "Zoom Out" button. The "Zoom Out" button will reduce the zoom level, allowing you to view larger portions of the Mandelbrot set.


**Color Scheme**

The color scheme is designed to make the Mandelbrot set visually appealing. Points inside the set are colored black, creating a sharp contrast between the set and its surroundings. Points outside the set are colored using a custom color gradient based on the number of iterations. The hue of the color varies as the number of iterations increases, creating smooth transitions between colors. This results in beautiful patterns and an engaging visualization of the Mandelbrot set.

**Interactivity**

The Mandelbrot set visualization is interactive, allowing you to explore different regions of the set by clicking on the canvas or using the "Zoom In" button to zoom in, and the "Zoom Out" button to zoom out. The colors and patterns will dynamically adjust based on your interactions, providing an immersive experience in the world of fractals.

**Enjoy Exploring the Mandelbrot Set!**
